			Official statistics show that more than 41,100 Americans kill themselves every year.  The true figure is probably higher.  The number of non-fatal suicide attempts is considerably greater, often resulting in serious injuries, trauma to families and friends, and economic loss to our society.

			Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among young people ages 15-24, and is the 10th leading cause of death overall.

			Suicide occurs across all ages, economic, social and ethnic boundaries.

			Surviving family members not only suffer the trauma of losing a loved one to suicide, but are themselves at potentially higher risk of suicide and emotional problems.

			Most suicidal persons give definite warnings of their suicidal thoughts, but those closest to them are either unaware of the significance of these warnings or do not know how to respond to them.

			The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) collects data about mortality in the U.S., including deaths by suicide. In 2013 (the most recent year for which full data are available), 41,149 suicides were reported, making suicide the 10th leading cause of death for Americans (Figure 1). In that year, someone in the country died by suicide every 12.8 minutes.

			<strong>Are Suicide Rates Still Rising?</strong>

			CDC figures for death by suicide are currently lagging by more than a year. Information is not yet available for 2015.

			<h3>Who is Most at Risk for Death by Suicide?</h3>

		</p>	

			Suicide death rates vary considerably among different groups of people. The CDC reports suicide rates by four key demographic variables: age, sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region/state. In 2013, the highest suicide rate (19.1) was among people 45 to 64 years old. The second highest rate (18.6) occurred in those 85 years and older. Younger groups have had consistently lower suicide rates than middle-aged and older adults. In 2013, adolescents and young adults aged 15 to 24 had a suicide rate of 10.9
